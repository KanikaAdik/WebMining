    "## 1. Why Selenium\n",
    "- So far, we have learned how to scrape **static** HTML pages using **Requests + BeautifulSoup**\n",
    "- However, if the web content relies on **javascript or AJAX** to build the content, this combination does not work\n",
    "  - Elements in a web page loaded **asynchronously**\n",
    "     * while requests.get(url) can only return the initial content\n",
    "     * you may need to wait for a while to get web content fully loaded\n",
    "  - You need to **interact with the page** to get some content loaded, e.g.\n",
    "     * scroll down to load more\n",
    "     * click a button like \"more\"\n",
    "     * fill a form\n",
    "- Example: https://www.quora.com/topic/Machine-Learning"

    "  - Place the webdrive (unzip it if the download is zipped) in a folder, e.g. a sub-folder called `drive` under the current working folder. When call selenium, point the `executable_path` parameter to that folder, i.e. `driver = webdriver.Firefox(executable_path='driver/geckodriver')`\n",
